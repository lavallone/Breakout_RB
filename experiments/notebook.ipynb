Thanks to ***restraining bolts*** (logical specifications which restrains agent behaviour in a custom manner), we can guide the way in which is possible to break the bricks. In these experiments it's shown how we can teach the breaking direction: both *left-to-right* ⏩⏩⏩ and *right-to-left* ⏪⏪⏪. We employed two different RL algorithms: ***Q-learning*** and ***SARSA***. In all the experiments is shown which one is used. \n","\n","To highlight strengths and weaknesses of the methods, we differentiated the experiments based on *bricks setting* (**3x3**, **4x4** and **8x3**) and on the *actions* the agent could use it (**only ball** ⚾️  and **fire plus ball** 🔥⚾️). We first tested the \"plain\" *restraining bolts* where the LTLf/LDLf specifications are already known in advance, and then, through a mechanism of *Imitation Learning*, *restraining bolts* where its logical specifications are learned by observing an *expert*. The expert agent in our case has a single state represantion and can **only fire** 🔥 (to make the learning of the optimal policy as simple as possible). The latest experiments show how the *learners* (agents which imitate expert's behaviour) behave conformly to the restraining bolt specifications without knowing them a priori.\n","\n","## Restraining Bolts\n","\n","### 3x3 bricks setting <br> <br> 🧱 🧱 🧱 <br> 🧱 🧱 🧱 <br> 🧱 🧱 🧱\n","\n","#### ⚾️ BALL\n","\n","<div style=\"display: flex;
